# CSC301 - Assignment 5 - Red-black Tree
Govind Brahmanyapura, Charun Upara

This program is an implementation of the red-black tree data structure. First, the program will generate ten random numbers by utilizing the Linear Feedback Shift Register algorithm. Then, those ten numbers will be added to the tree while making sure that the five properties of red-black trees are maintained. After inserting these values, the tree would allow the user to update the content by either adding new nodes or deleting existing nodes. After each insert or delete operation, the program would print the newly updated tree.
